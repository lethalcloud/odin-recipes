<h3>A favorite family recipe that my Mom has made for hundreds of guests. Fresh lemon juice and mint leaves are a must! Serve over hot cooked white rice.</h3>




<h1>Ingredients</h1>

<ul>
    <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces
    <li>1 clove garlic, crushed
    <li>½ cup all-purpose flour
    <li>½ cup margarine
    <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice
    <li>½ cup chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
</ul>




<h1>Steps</h1>

<ol>
    <li><p>In a medium bowl, mix together the chicken pieces and garlic. Toss with the flour just to coat, and shake off excess.</p>
    
    <li>Heat the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces; cook and stir until browned. Add the mint leaves and lemon juice, cover and steam for about 5 minutes, just until the chicken is cooked through. Do not over cook the chicken or it will be tough.
    </li>
</ol>
